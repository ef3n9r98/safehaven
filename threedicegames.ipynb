    "The first dice game is with Nietzsche's deamon where you wager all your money with every round. Imagine you're sitting at a table with your entire net worth in front of you. Behind that is Nietzsche's deamon. He makes you an offer to play a dice game. If you roll a 1, he'll take away 50% of your net worth. If you roll a 2, 3, 4 or 5, he'll give you 5% of what's on the table (net worth * 1.05 = new net worth). And if you roll a 6, he'll give you 50% of what's on the table. "

Then if you roll a 3, the \\$750 will become \\$787.50. Each roll is cummulative! Nietzsche will roll 300 times, and you'll get to walk away with whatever is left. The question that remains is: would you play? "

    "That was the second game. This third and final game is a special one where you get to use insurance. Instead of 40:60, it'll be 91:9. 91% goes towards the bet, and 9% goes towards paying for insurance. If you roll a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, that 9% is just a loss. But if you roll a 1, then the 9% will pay you back 5 fold. For example, if you have $1000 and roll a 1, then you first separate 910 and 90. The 910 gets cut in half to become 455. But the 90 gets multiplied by 5 to become 450. So your total wealth after the first roll becomes 455 + 450 = 905. \n",
